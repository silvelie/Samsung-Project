# Samsung-Project

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts columns containing mean and standard deviation for each measurement (Hint: Since some feature/column names are repeated, you may need to use the make.names() function in R)
* Creates variables called ActivityLabel and ActivityName that label all observations with the corresponding activity labels and names respectively
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
